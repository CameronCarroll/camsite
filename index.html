          <h2>Howling Wastes Garden</h2>
        </header>

        <p> After days of walking through the wasteland you assume you are seeing a hallucination. In the dying light, the horizon presents a huge structure with... light! They have power! You hurry forward with hope and renewed spring in your step. <br>

         A minute later, you find a sapling growing - &#127793 ! Interesting... hardly anything grows after the great Sea Blooms began.<br>
       </p>
       <p>
         As you finally approach the gates of the huge walls, a small holo sign catches your eye.
         <small> NOTICE: Jawas have been sighted in the area, all travelers are advised to use caution. They have already stolen all of the text links and replaced them with images! <i>A Jawa is shown in the piercing detail and vibrant colors of the holo, which is somehow more real to you than the world around you.</i><br /> <img src="/images/gold/jawa.gif" alt="Pacing Jawa armed with a blaster rifle."></small>
