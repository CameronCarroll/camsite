      <li> <a href="/The_Shed/index.html">To the Shed (where useful things are stored. Hopefully. If they were put back.)</a>
      <li> <a href="/Bower/index.html">Through the Bower toward the Cloister and backyard / forest.</a> (Anything too serious gets banished to the cloister, and the backyard is just full of crap.)
      <li> <a href="/Raised_Beds/index.html">To the Raised Beds (where things are tended nicely. Hopefully.)</a>

        <p> After days of walking through the wasteland you assume you are seeing a hallucination. In the dying light, the horizon presents a huge structure with... light! They have power! You hurry forward with hope and renewed spring in your step. <br>

         A minute later, you find a sapling growing - &#127793 ! Interesting... hardly anything grows after the great Sea Blooms began.<br>

         As you finally approach the gates of the huge walls, a small holo sign catches your eye.
         <small> NOTICE: Jawas have been sighted in the area, all travelers are advised to use caution. They have already stolen all of the text links and replaced them with images! <i>A Jawa is shown in the piercing detail and vibrant colors of the holo, which appears more real to you than the world around you.</i><br /> <img src="/images/gold/jawa.gif" alt="Pacing Jawa armed with a blaster rifle."></small>

        You find a round metal pad set into the stone - a teleporter pad, you know having learned the hard way. (Its safety mechanism won't trigger until you have both feet and all body parts inside of the pad's envelope.)
        Do you...
        1. Stick your foot in and touch the pad with one toe
        <a href="/pages/obsdeck.html"> 2. Grit your teeth and stride onto the pad </a>
        3. Walk away
