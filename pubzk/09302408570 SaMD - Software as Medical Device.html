<p>**
<strong>Does FDA regulate SaMD?</strong>**</p>

<p>SaMD is defined by IMDRF. For software to be regulated by FDA as a device, the software must meet the definition discussed in [[09272407361 RN FDA Webinar Digital Health]]</p>

<p>**
<strong>Medical purpose vs non-medical-purpose software</strong>**</p>

<p>Software used to make or maintain a device (eg testing, source code management, servicing) is not considered to be software with a medical purpose (by IMDRF).</p>

<p>**
<strong>Definition of SaMD</strong>**</p>

<pre><code>Software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.

NOTES:
- 'without being part of' means software not necessary for a hardware medical device to achieve its intended medical purpose
- Software does not meet the definition of SaMD if its intended purpose is to drive a hardware medical device
- SaMD is a medical device.

<strong>Read on functions typical in active implantable ecosystem</strong>**</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software that turns on / off therapy cannot be SaMD <em>(drives a hardware medical device).</em></li>
  <li>Software that programs the therapy parameters cannot be SaMD (<em>because that software <strong>is</strong> necessary for the hardware implant to meet its intended medical purpose</em>)</li>
  <li>Software that receives, stores and transmits patient / device information (eg some server collecting device logs / registration information)… <em>well, depends on whether we are a “Medical Device” per IMDRF definition. I don’t think so. I think that’s falling on the non-medical-purpose side of things.</em></li>
  <li>Software that pushes patches down to the implant (<em>aka servicing, which was called out as ‘not considered software with a medical purpose’ in the note in Introduction section of  SaMD WG/N10</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hm, where does that put us for Mainstay? RC/Prog. as SiMD? (software in medical device)? Or software as accessory to medical device…</em></p>
