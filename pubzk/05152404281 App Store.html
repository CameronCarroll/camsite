<strong>Google Play Store</strong>**</p>

- Create Google Play Developer Account
- We prepare an ‘Android Apple Bundle’ (.aab file) or ‘Android Package’ (.apk file) containing app binary
- Also prepare app metadata (name, description, screenshots, etc)
- Then set up app listings in Google Play Console w/ pricing, content ratings, distribution options, etc.
- Apps must be signed, either using upload key (??) or a key from Google’s App Signing service.
- We then upload out app bundle and Google performs an automated content review.
- After content review, app is published in Google Play Store.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Managed Google Play” to manage app distribution.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Managed apps are installed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using a managed app approach allows more control (??) over managed apps, allow to remotely remove unallowed apps.</li>
</ul>
