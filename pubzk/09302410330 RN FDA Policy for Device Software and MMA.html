    <h3>09302410330 RN FDA Policy for Device Software and MMA</h3>
  </header>
    <main>
    <p>Class: NP</p>

<p>**
<strong>Reviewed the FDA’s “Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications”</strong>**</p>

<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/80958/download</p>

<p>This guidance discusses FDA’s approach to regulating medical device software.</p>

<p>FDA regulatory approach looks at the function rather than the platform. Bins software as:
1. Software functions that are not medical devices
2. Software for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion
3. Software that is the focus of FDA’s oversight:
	i. <strong>Software that transforms a mobile platform into a regulated medical device</strong> (typically via a mobile app) eg by connecting sensors/leads for an ECG, as an electronic stethoscope, to measure physiological parameters during CPR (eg using accelerometer), and like a dozen more examples in the guidance.
	ii. <strong>Software that connects to an existing device</strong> (eg implant or wearable device), eg <strong>altering function/settings</strong> of an infusion pump or neurostimulator or cochlear implant, controls inflation of a blood pressure cuff, or used to calibrate hearing aids.
	iii. <strong>Software used in active patient monitoring</strong> (Particularly focused on information that is used for an immediate medical response, eg monitoring of labor progress, bedside / cardiac monitors, clinical test equipment that provides recommendations for treatment, etc etc.)</p>

<p>Explicit callouts that phone vendors, app store vendors, and suppliers of support tools are not in scope as a medical device manufacturer just because their platform was used to support a device.</p>

<p>Also some discussion of the historical changes in the last ~15 years. eg some exemptions that were added to FD&amp;C <em>(that we discussed over in [[09272407361 RN FDA Webinar Digital Health]])</em></p>
