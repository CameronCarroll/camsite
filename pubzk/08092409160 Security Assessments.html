<h2 id="soc-2-system-and-organization-controls-2">SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assessment of organization’s controls on data security, availability, integrity, and privacy.</li>
  <li>Two types of reports:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Type 1</strong> - Point in time assessment, scoped only to the design of controls. Are the controls appropriately designed?</li>
      <li><strong>Type 2</strong> - Covers a specific period of time, includes auditing design and actual effectiveness of controls. (Typically 6 months to 1 year timeframe. Audit actually takes 1-2 months.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment is based on the five Trust Services Criteria:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Security</strong> - Protect against unauthorized access/disclosure.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability</strong> - Reliable operation and use.</li>
      <li><strong>Processing integrity</strong> - System processing is complete, valid, accurate, and timely.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> - Information is protected from disclosure.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Personal information safeguarded against access/disclosure.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Only security is required—the other criteria depend on the specific system/customer needs.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Part of a suite of assessments provided by AICPA (Certified Public Accountants, weird).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SOC 1</strong> is focused on financial reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>SOC 2</strong> is on data/IT, but this report type is for confidential visibility only. (WP Engine gave Mainstay their SOC 2 Type 2 report.)</li>
      <li><strong>SOC 3</strong> is like a summary of SOC 2 Type II, providing assurance on the controls but without the detailed information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Does a SOC 2 Type 2 report expire?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>No, it is technically valid forever, but customers will typically want periodically updated reports, e.g., annually. Most companies plan for annual SOC 2 audits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Time and cost investment:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time</strong> - Could take 6 months to get a compliance program ready, and then need 6 months to a year of data, so may need to plan 1.5 years ahead of a contract that requires SOC 2 compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> - Small/midsize companies can expect ~$20,000 and larger organizations $30,000 to $100,000.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iso-27001">ISO 27001</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Standard for information security management systems:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk management</strong> - What are the risks and how are they mitigated?</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring, measurement, analysis &amp; evaluation</strong> - How is the effectiveness of the system evaluated?</li>
      <li><strong>Improvement</strong> - How are nonconformities evaluated and corrected?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fedramp-federal-risk-and-authorization-management-program">FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>US federal government program for cloud product security assessments. (e.g., for infrastructure, platform, and software as a service type offerings)</li>
  <li>‘FISMA for the cloud’</li>
  <li>Any cloud services that hold federal data must be FedRAMP authorized.</li>
  <li>Assessments performed by third-party assessment organizations which are accredited.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fisma-federal-information-security-management-act-of-2002">FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002)</h2>
