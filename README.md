Hiya.

This my site, currently http://ieve.me
Started November 2019 - Kiya Sana
Currently being updated as of December 2023.

Build environment: None -- This website will be plain HTML/CSS with no external dependencies.

How were we serving this locally?
ruby -rwebrick -e'WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 8000, :DocumentRoot => Dir.pwd).start'
It's just because I had a Ruby snippet for web server handy, not because the project is using Ruby in any way.
