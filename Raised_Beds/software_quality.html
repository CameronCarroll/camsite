        My Research Team (Claude) helped me come up with <a href="learning_plan.html">a plan based on me and my company's gaps</a>.

        And also they suggested where to focus for next phase milestone / to ensure inputs are captured appropriately:
        <ol>
          <li> SDLC Procedure
          <li> Software Requirements Management Procedure (outline how requirements are gathered / documented / managed throughout development process, ensure traceability and ensure all requirements are addressed.)
          <li> Software Risk Management Procedure (How are software risks identified, analyzed, mitigated - integrated with existing risk system)
          <li> Cybersecurity Procedure
          <li> Software Configuration Management (how we manage different versions of software including source code, docs, and built artifacts)
          <li> Software V&V Plan - What types of testing will be performed, how will we approach V&V
        </ol>

        We have a lot of reading to do lol.

        <p>Company doing in-house software development for active implantable for the first time. (We have an existing device on market, but software was developed through a contract manufacturer / on their platform.)<br />
         There is no one on staff who knows how to do the QMS / QE aspects of software development and maintenance. (We have 2 programmers, 2 software tester guys (<i>totally ignoring hardware development / production here</i>) and they are full speed ahead actually making a product.)</p>
        <p>My job... get the thing they're building to market without anybody dying or anyone going to jail.</p>
        <p> Luckily I think... if I can focus and get out of sustaining [the current generation product] hell, that I am actually the person for the job. I'm a bit of a jack of all trades, with some comfort in manufacturing/process engineering, electrical design, software <s>development</s> <small>(coding my own crap)</small>, IT/linux/server admin, navigating regulations and satisfying <small>(lol)</small> regulators. And there's an opportunity here -- the product development team is so focused on building a "thing" that they aren't thinking about the changes that need to take place in the business (staffing, systems).</p>
        <p> So, in a little more detail, we need to build software quality management systems into our business, and ensure our development processes / outputs / sustaining processes are complaint to the relevant "state-of-the-art" standards and guidances. <br />
          On one hand, I feel like I have no idea what that entails. But FDA is real serious about it I think. Also about cybersecurity. And this product is coming down the pipe fast, so we better figure it out.
