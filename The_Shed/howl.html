       <h2>Portal to the Howling Wastes Oasis</h2>
     </header>

     <p> You jiggle the floorboard and hear a loud groan of the entire shed around you before <b> CRASHING SOUND </b> <i>the floor gives out under you and you tumble into the dark, hitting your head and losing consciousness in the process. (Don't worry, you don't get a concussion.) -- -- You wake up with a splitting headache and the light of the sun in your eyes.</i> </p>

     <p>

       Something something I don't even know where this story was trying to go I just needed to make a place for it because it couldn't stay where it was.

      After days of walking through the wasteland you assume you are seeing a hallucination. In the dying light, the horizon presents a huge structure with... light! They have power! You hurry forward with hope and renewed spring in your step. <br>

      A minute later, you find a sapling growing - &#127793 ! Interesting... hardly anything grows after the great Sea Blooms began.<br>
    </p>

      As you finally approach the gates of the huge walls, a small holo sign catches your eye.
      <small> NOTICE: Jawas have been sighted in the area, all travelers are advised to use caution. They have already stolen all of the text links and replaced them with images! <i>A Jawa is shown in the piercing detail and vibrant colors of the holo, which is somehow more real to you than the world around you.</i><br /> <img src="/images/gold/jawa.gif" alt="Pacing Jawa armed with a blaster rifle."></small>
